# Koha Interlibrary Loans ILLSLNPKoha backend

## about SLNP
SLNP (TM) (Simple Library Network Protocol) is a TCP network socket based protocol 
designed and introduced by the company Sisis Informationssysteme GmbH (later a part of OCLC) 
for their library management system SISIS-SunRise (TM).
This protocol supports the bussiness processes of libraries.
A subset of SLNP that enables the communication required for regional an national ILL (Inter Library Loan) processes
has been published by Sisis Informationssysteme GmbH as basis for 
connection of library management systems to ILL servers that use SLNP.
Sisis Informationssysteme GmbH / OCLC owns all rights to SLNP.
SLNP is a registered trademark of Sisis Informationssysteme GmbH / OCLC.

## Synopsis
The ILL backend 'ILLSLNPKoha'  provides a simple method to handle Interlibrary Loan requests that are initiated by an regional ILL server using the SLNP protocol.
The additional service 'ILLZFLServerKoha' runs as a daemon in the background managing the communication with the regional ILL server and inserting records in tables illrequests and illrequestattributes 
by calling the 'create' method of ILLSLNPKoha. 
The remaining features of this ILL backend are accessible via the standard ILL framework in the Koha staff interface.

## Installing
* Create a directory in '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha' called 'Illbackends', so you will end up with '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends'.
* Clone the repository into this directory, so you will end up with '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha'.
* In the 'ILLSLNPKoha' directory switch to the branch you wish to use, matching your currently checked out branch of Koha-LMSCloud.
* Load default values into table 'systempreferences' and into table 'letter' and update koha-conf.xml by calling
`
  export KOHA_INSTANZ=<the_name_of_your_Koha_instance>; 
  export KOHA_CONF=/etc/koha/sites/$KOHA_INSTANZ/koha-conf.xml; 
  export PERL5LIB=/usr/share/koha/lib; 
  cd $PERL5LIB/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/install; 
  ./install.pl; 
`
* Activate the Koha ILL framwork and ILL backends by enabling the 'ILLModule' system preference.
* Check the <interlibrary_loans> division in your koha-conf.xml.
* Copy the Net::Server::Fork configuration file '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/ILLZFLServerKoha/conf/ILLZFLServerKoha.conf' into directory '/etc/koha/sites/{name-of-your-Koha-instance}/'.
* Adapt the Net::Server::Fork configuration file '/etc/koha/sites/{name-of-your-Koha-instance}/ILLZFLServerKoha.conf', otherwise ILLZFLServerKoha will not work.
* Copy the service script '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/ILLZFLServerKoha/conf/koha-ILLZFLServerKoha' into directory '/etc/init.d'
* Register the service script '/etc/init.d/koha-ILLZFLServerKoha' by calling 'update-rc.d koha-ILLZFLServerKoha defaults'.
+ Now the service ILLZFLServerKoha may be started (or stopped) by calling '/etc/init.d/koha-ILLZFLServerKoha start (or stop)' or by 'service koha-ILLZFLServerKoha start (or stop)'.
* Call hierarchy: '/etc/init.d/koha-ILLZFLServerKoha' calls '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/ILLZFLServerKoha/bin/koha-ILLZFLServerKoha.sh' that calls '/usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/ILLZFLServerKoha/bin/runILLZFLServerKoha.pl' that finally starts (or stops) the daemon.
* It is strongly recommended to encrypt the communication between the regional ILL SLNPServer and ILLZFLServerKoha (e.g. by using stunnel)

## Configuration
You have to adapt the default values of the additional ILL preferences loaded into table systempreferences by $PERL5LIB/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/install/install.pl to your requirements. 
The additional ILL preferences are listed with a short description in the load file $PERL5LIB/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/install/insert_systempreferences.sql.
You may use the additional ILL letter layouts "as is" or you can adapt them to your needs. 
The additional ILL letter layouts are contained in the load file $PERL5LIB/Koha/Illbackends/ILLSLNPKoha/install/insert_letter.sql.
